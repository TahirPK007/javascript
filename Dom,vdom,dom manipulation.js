//DOM
//DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents and represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like model. The DOM provides a way to access, manipulate, and update the elements and content of a web page dynamically.

//VDOM
//VDOM, on the other hand, stands for Virtual DOM. It is a concept that represents a lightweight copy or abstraction of the actual DOM. Virtual DOM is typically used in frameworks like React to optimize rendering performance and provide a more efficient way of updating the user interface.

//DOM MANIPULATION
//DOM manipulation refers to the process of accessing and modifying elements and properties of the DOM tree. It allows developers to dynamically change the content, style, and structure of a web page based on user interactions or application logic. DOM manipulation can involve tasks such as selecting elements, modifying their attributes or content, adding or removing elements, and handling events.
